I am a master's student funded by the [São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)](https://fapesp.br/en) at the [Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture](http://www.cena.usp.br/) of the University of São Paulo (Brazil). I’ll soon be starting as a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) under the supervision of [apl. Prof. Gerd Gleixner](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en-gerd-gleixner.html) in 2025

During my M.Sc, I worked in Prof. [Tsai Siu Mui's](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/216/tsai-siu-mui) group on the soil microbial carbon metabolism across tropical agroforests, with a particular emphasis on the dissolved organic matter molecular composition and its relation to microbial community function

I am a soil microbial and chemical ecologist fascinated by plant-soil-microbes interactions. My goal as a (microbial) researcher is to explore the complex interactions between the aboveground plants and the belowground soil and microbes in tropical ecosystems in the context of climate change

To accomplish this, I use various methods like metabolomics and genomics.
