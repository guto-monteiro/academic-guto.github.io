I am a master's student funded by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) at the Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture of the University of São Paulo (Brazil). I’ll soon be starting as a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) in 2025

During my M.Sc, I worked in Prof. [Tsai Siu Mui's](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/pesquisador/216/tsai-siu-mui) group on the soil microbial carbon metabolism across tropical agroforests, with a particular emphasis on the dissolved organic matter molecular composition and its relation to microbial community function

Research interests
======
"Essentially, all life depends upon the soil. There can be no life without soil and no soil without life. They have evolved together." (C. Kellogg)

I am a soil microbial and chemical ecologist fascinated by plant-soil-microbes interactions. My goal as a (microbial) researcher is to explore the complex interactions between the aboveground plants and the belowground soil and microbes in tropical ecosystems in the context of climate change

To accomplish this, I use various methods like metabolomics and genomics.
